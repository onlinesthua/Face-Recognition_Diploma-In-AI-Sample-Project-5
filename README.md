This project focuses on Face Recognition as a Computer Vision deep learning problem. Face Recognition involves identifying or verifying individuals from digital images or video frames. The project will explore different Siamese models for face recognition tasks.

By implementing and comparing various Siamese architectures, participants will understand how Siamese networks learn to compute similarity between pairs of images. They will explore the use of contrastive and triplet loss functions to train Siamese models effectively for face recognition tasks, considering factors such as pose variation, illumination changes, and occlusions.

Potential uses:
1.	Access Control: Authenticating individuals for secure access to buildings or digital devices.
2.	Law Enforcement: Matching faces against databases of known criminals or missing persons.
3.	Retail Analytics: Analyzing customer demographics and behavior based on facial recognition data.

Learning outcomes:
1.	Understanding of Siamese networks and their application in face recognition tasks.
2.	Proficiency in implementing Siamese architectures using TensorFlow and Keras.
3.	Ability to evaluate the performance of face recognition models using metrics such as accuracy and ROC curves.

This project is prepared by Chen Yijie under the supervision of Zhou Changxin.
